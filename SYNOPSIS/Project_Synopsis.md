## 1. INTRODUCTION

The First Come First Serve (FCFS) CPU Scheduling Algorithm is one of the fundamental scheduling algorithms in operating systems. This project implements a comprehensive FCFS scheduling system with a modern web interface, providing both educational value and practical utility.

FCFS operates on a simple principle: processes are executed in the order they arrive in the ready queue. The first process to arrive is the first to be allocated CPU time, regardless of burst time or priority. While simple in concept, FCFS implementation requires careful consideration of process management, timing calculations, and user interface design.

This project bridges theoretical concepts with practical implementation, offering a platform for understanding CPU scheduling algorithms through interactive visualization and real-time calculations.

---

## 2. PROBLEM STATEMENT

CPU scheduling is a critical aspect of operating system design, directly impacting system efficiency and user experience. Traditional approaches to teaching CPU scheduling algorithms often rely on static examples that fail to demonstrate the dynamic nature of process execution.

Specific problems addressed by this project include:

1. **Accessibility Gap**: Existing implementations often lack user-friendly interfaces, making them inaccessible to beginners.
2. **Visualization Deficiency**: Many implementations fail to provide clear visual representations of scheduling processes.
3. **Integration Challenges**: Few solutions integrate theory with practical, interactive implementations.
4. **Educational Limitations**: Current educational tools often separate theory from implementation, creating a learning gap.

This project aims to bridge these gaps by creating an intuitive, web-based implementation of the FCFS algorithm that visualizes the scheduling process and provides detailed performance metrics.

---

## 3. OBJECTIVES

1. **Primary Objectives**:
   - Implement the FCFS CPU scheduling algorithm in C++
   - Develop a responsive web interface for interaction with the algorithm

2. **Secondary Objectives**:
   - Create an educational tool for understanding CPU scheduling
   - Demonstrate client-server architecture in a web application
   - Showcase modern web technologies integrated with C++ backend
   - Implement effective error handling and input validation

3. **Learning Objectives**:
   - Gain practical experience in algorithm implementation
   - Develop skills in full-stack development
