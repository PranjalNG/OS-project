1. INTRODUCTION

The First Come First Serve (FCFS) CPU Scheduling Algorithm is one of the fundamental scheduling algorithms in operating systems. This project implements a comprehensive FCFS scheduling system with a modern web interface, providing both educational value and practical utility.

FCFS operates on a simple principle: processes are executed in the order they arrive in the ready queue. The first process to arrive is the first to be allocated CPU time, regardless of burst time or priority. While simple in concept, FCFS implementation requires careful consideration of process management, timing calculations, and user interface design.

This project bridges theoretical concepts with practical implementation, offering a platform for understanding CPU scheduling algorithms through interactive visualization and real-time calculations.

1.1 Background of the Project

CPU scheduling is a core function of operating systems, determining how processor time is allocated to processes. The First Come First Serve algorithm, being the simplest scheduling algorithm, serves as an excellent starting point for understanding scheduling concepts.

In academic settings, the theoretical understanding of scheduling algorithms is often separated from their practical implementation. This project aims to bridge this gap by providing a comprehensive implementation with visual representation, helping users gain both theoretical and practical knowledge.

1.2 Significance of the Project

This project holds significance in multiple domains:

• Educational Value: Provides a clear, interactive demonstration of FCFS scheduling principles
• Practical Implementation: Demonstrates real-world application of theoretical concepts
• Technical Skill Development: Combines multiple technologies (C++, Web Development, Algorithms)
• Interface Design: Showcases effective visualization of complex processes

2. PROBLEM STATEMENT

CPU scheduling is a critical aspect of operating system design, directly impacting system efficiency and user experience. Traditional approaches to teaching CPU scheduling algorithms often rely on static examples that fail to demonstrate the dynamic nature of process execution.

Specific problems addressed by this project include:

2.1 Accessibility Gap
Existing implementations often lack user-friendly interfaces, making them inaccessible to beginners and students learning operating system concepts.

2.2 Visualization Deficiency
Many implementations fail to provide clear visual representations of scheduling processes, making it difficult to understand the temporal aspects of process execution.

2.3 Integration Challenges
Few solutions integrate theory with practical, interactive implementations, creating a gap between conceptual understanding and applied knowledge.

2.4 Educational Limitations
Current educational tools often separate theory from implementation, making it difficult for learners to connect concepts with actual execution.

This project aims to bridge these gaps by creating an intuitive, web-based implementation of the FCFS algorithm that visualizes the scheduling process and provides detailed performance metrics.
