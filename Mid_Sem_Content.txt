*** SLIDE 2: PROJECT OVERVIEW ***
Title: Project Overview

• Objective: 
  - Implementation of FCFS CPU scheduling algorithm with interactive web interface

• Technology Stack:
  - Backend: C++ with Crow Framework
  - Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript

• Purpose:
  - Demonstrate CPU scheduling concepts through interactive visualization

*** SLIDE 3: WHAT IS CPU SCHEDULING? ***
Title: Understanding CPU Scheduling

• Definition:
  - Process of determining which process runs on the CPU at a given time

• Importance:
  - Efficient CPU utilization
  - Fair process execution
  - System performance optimization

• Real-world Example:
  - Bank queue system (first customer gets served first)

*** SLIDE 4: FIRST COME FIRST SERVE (FCFS) ***
Title: First Come First Serve (FCFS)

• Basic Concept:
  - First process to arrive gets executed first
  - Simple queuing mechanism

• Characteristics:
  - Non-preemptive scheduling
  - Simple to implement
  - Fair in terms of arrival order

• Example Scenario:
  Process 1: Arrival = 0, Burst = 5
  Process 2: Arrival = 2, Burst = 3
  Process 3: Arrival = 4, Burst = 2

*** SLIDE 5: KEY METRICS ***
Title: Key Performance Metrics

• Arrival Time:
  - When a process enters the ready queue

• Burst Time:
  - Time required for process execution

• Completion Time:
  - When a process finishes execution

• Turnaround Time:
  - Total time from arrival to completion

• Waiting Time:
  - Time spent waiting in the ready queue

*** SLIDE 6: PROJECT FEATURES ***
Title: Project Features

• Interactive Web Interface:
  - Process input form
  - Real-time process list
  - Results visualization

• Backend Processing:
  - FCFS algorithm implementation
  - Time calculations
  - JSON data handling

*** SLIDE 7: TECHNICAL ARCHITECTURE ***
Title: System Architecture
